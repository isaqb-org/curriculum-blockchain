[[LG-1-1]]
==== LG 1-1: Definition of Blockchain Terminology

* know the definition of Blockchain and DLT
* know the main concepts and terminology of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT)
* know the definition of Smart Contracts and Decentralised Applications (DApps)
* understand how Blockchain Technology enabled Cryptocurrencies and Tokens

[[LG-1-2]]
==== LG 1-2: Basic operation of a blockchain

* understand the interaction of all components to form a coherent system
** a peer-to-peer network composed of nodes that propagate transactions and blocks
** a miner as a special type of node that forges blocks that include transactions
** a wallet as a piece of software that manages addresses
* able to navigate the complex terminology of blockchains
** the role of Bitcoin (or any other blockchain) as a stereotypical cryptocurrency
** the generalized role of the blockchain as a distributed, append-only ledger

[[LG-1-3]]
==== LG 1-3: Cryptographic primitives

* know the cryptographic properties of hashing and digital signatures
** a hash function can be computed easily, but finding the inverse is computationally infeasible
** a signature algorithm requires a private key to produce a signature, but only a public key to verify

[[LG-1-4]]
==== LG 1-4: Nakamoto consensus

* understand the design constraints leading to Byzantine fault tolerance
* know the notion of "longest chain wins"
* understand the evolution of the protocol itself by majority
* understand the mechanisms of soft and hard forks

[[LG-1-5]]
==== LG 1-5: Trade-offs

* able to appraise the trade-offs of a blockchain compared to a traditional architecture
* understand the hardware resources required for Proof-of-Work
* know the advantages and disadvantages of a distributed, no-trust approach
